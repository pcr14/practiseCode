<p style="display:inline;">Many years ago in the Andes Mountains there
     lived a cold-eyed witch. All through the summer she slept.  
 But at the first snowfall she awoke, full of glee. For winter was her hunting time and her eating time. By some strange magic she was able to draw children to her one by one, and how she did it no one knew. But the truth is that she had a magic ball, a ball bright and shining and of many colors, and this she left in places where children played, but never where a grown
  man or woman could see it.</p>
